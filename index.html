<h3>History</h3>


<div class="transbox">    
<p class="dropcap">Starbucks Corporation is an American global coffee company and coffeehouse chain based in <em>Seattle, Washington.</em> Starbucks is the largest coffeehouse company in the world, with <strong>20,891</strong> stores in <strong>62</strong> countries, including <strong>13.279</strong> in the <em>United States,</em><strong>1,324</strong> in <em>Canada</em>, <strong>989</strong> in <em>Japan,</em> <strong>851</strong> in <em>China</em> and <strong>806</strong> in the <em>United Kingdom.</em> In addition, <em>Starbucks</em> is an active member of the <em>World Cocoa Foundation.</em>
<em>Starbucks</em> locations serve hot and cold beverages, whole-bean coffee, microground instant coffee, full-leaf teas, pastries, and snacks. Most stores also sell pre-packaged food items, hot and cold sandwiches, and items such as mugs and tumblers. <em>Starbucks</em> Evenings locations also offer a variety of beers, wines, and appetizers after 4pm. Through the <em>Starbucks</em> Entertainment division and Hear Music brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also offered at grocery stores.</p>

<p>From <em>Starbucks'</em> founding in <strong>1971</strong> as a <em>Seattle</em> coffee bean roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. Since <strong>1987,</strong> <em>Starbucks</em> has opened on average two new stores every day.<em>Starbucks</em> had been profitable as a local company in <em>Seattle</em> in the early <strong>1980s</strong> but lost money on its late <strong>1980s</strong> expansion into the <em>Midwest</em> and <em>British Columbia.</em> Its fortunes did not reverse until the fiscal year of <strong>1989-1990,</strong> when it registered a small profit of <strong>$812,000.</strong> By the time it expanded into <em>California</em> in <strong>1991</strong> it had become trendy. The first store outside the <em>United States</em> or <em>Canada</em> opened in <em>Tokyo</em> in <strong>1996,</strong> and overseas stores now constitute almost one third of <em>Starbucks'</em> stores. The company planned to open a net of <strong>900</strong> new stores outside of the <em>United States</em> in <strong>2009,</strong> but has announced <strong>300</strong> store closures in the <em>United Staes</em> since <strong>2008.</strong></p>
